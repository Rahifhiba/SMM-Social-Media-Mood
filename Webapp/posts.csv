Soma_Man77,CMV: Israel is better than Palestine,"I know that Israel is committing atrocities in Gaza and allow illegal settlements in the West Bank. It's horrible. But the Palestinians aren't better. They would do the same evil if they had the ability to do it. Look at Ocotber 7th. 85% to 90% of the People in the West Bank said in a survey that Hamas didn't committed atrocities on that day. Look at how often people in the West Bank throw stones as a symbol, which is meaningless against
a far better militarized country. But it shows their violence. Justifying it by saying stuff like ""the Zionists took their land so they have the right to riot"" doesn't help either. They lost every war. If you lose a war you have to accept losing territory. Like Germany after WW2. I'm a German myself. Imagine if I would create a right-wing terror group, going into Poland for murdering kidnapping people. 

Israel atleast cares for their own people. They have democracy, human rights and a good health system. They build shelters for them. While the Palestinian authorities enslave women and use their own people as bomb shields. Look at their demographic pyramids. The fact that they have so many young people proves their inability for progress.",i know that israel is committing atrocity in gaza and allow illegal settlement in the west bank it s horrible but the palestinian aren t better they would do the same evil if they had the ability to do it look at ocotber th to of the people in the west bank said in a survey that hamas didn t committed atrocity on that day look at how often people in the west bank throw stone a a symbol which is meaningless against a far better militarized country but it show their violence justifying it by saying stuff like the zionist took their land so they have the right to riot doesn t help either they lost every war if you lose a war you have to accept losing territory like germany after ww i m a german myself imagine if i would create a right wing terror group going into poland for murdering kidnapping people israel atleast care for their own people they have democracy human right and a good health system they build shelter for them while the palestinian authority enslave woman and use their own people a bomb shield look at their demographic pyramid the fact that they have so many young people prof their inability for progress
Suspicious-Truths,It wouldn’t matter where Israel is,"I just want to say this for everyone who may be stuck on it.

People (anti-zionists?) often bring up how Israel had a few proposed areas, such as Russia, South America, wherever else, deserted islands? 

They bring this up as if we should have gone somewhere else, not Palestine. And all of this is happening because Palestine was decided on instead of another place. 

I just want anyone struggling with this to know it wouldn’t have mattered, and probably would have been actually worse for us if we did go somewhere else. 

Israel’s current location we have proof we are genetically from this area. We have had Jews living in and around this area throughout all of history.

While some people ignore this fact and pretend we are white colonizers who discovered a new land with a native population, it would have been everyone thinking like this if we went to a region we definitely have 0 connection to. Yes, even if it was a deserted island, people would ask why WE deserve an island and nobody else gets one.

KeepChatting,why isn’t Israel’s pager attack considered a “terrorist attack”? ,"Are there any legal or technical reasons to differentiate the pager attack from other terrorist attacks? The whole pager thing feels very guerrilla-style and I can’t help but wonder what’s the difference?
