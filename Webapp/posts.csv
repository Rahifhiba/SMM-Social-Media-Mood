How to start python for a complete noob?,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/18l6y75/how_to_start_python_for_a_complete_noob/,Moist_Ad2828,"Hello guys, I have zero experience in programming and I've been watching some videos to learn python. 
I came across the word tutorial hell, and how noobs like me fall into it and give up programming. 
Since you guys are already experienced in coding how would you suggest I should learn python the correct way.

Thank you."
"YSK that Harvard recently launched an Intro to Programming with Python, and it includes a free certificate of completion.",23290,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/vo3ngt/ysk_that_harvard_recently_launched_an_intro_to/,manocormen,"Why YSK: I recently shared a [YSK about Harvard's Intro to CS](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/v35jdm/ysk_that_harvard_offers_a_free_certificate_for/), and many people seemed interested, so I thought you might also want to know about Harvard's new free Python course. :)

In April, Harvard University launched **Intro to Programming with Python**, a free 9-week course for complete beginners, which includes a free certificate of completion.

IMO, the course is excellent. It's taught by the same professor who teaches Harvard's Intro to CS, the university's most-popular on-campus course. He's super lively, and I think he explains things really well. 

The course is very hands-on, with the instructor live coding from the very beginning, and with weekly problem sets and a final project that you complete through an in-browser code editor.

Finally, when you finish the course, you get a free certificate of completion from Harvard that [looks like this](https://www.classcentral.com/report/harvard-cs50-python/). :)

Here's where you can take the course, through Harvard OpenCourseWare:

[https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

I hope this helps!

**Important**: You can also take the course via edX, but there, the certificate costs $199. If you take it through Harvard OpenCourseWare, the course is exactly the same, but the certificate is entirely free. :)"
[ORIGINAL] Python program that writes randomly-generated rap songs,10381,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/acwky9/original_python_program_that_writes/,saisenberg,"Hey all!

I hope this isn't breaking the HHH rules, but here goes - I wrote a Python app that uses Markov Chains to write its own randomly-generated rap songs (based on *real* rap lyrics that I scraped from RapGenius).

Hope you enjoy - check it out! The app has some memory and timeout issues, but I'm working to fix them. Happy to answer any questions!

EDIT: Looks like it got Reddit-hugg'd-to-death. I'm trying to clear some memory to get the app back up. Glad everyone's liking it!

EDIT2: Wow, thanks a ton for all your support. I'm honestly pretty blown away - was not expecting this level of feedback. Apologies for the app still being finicky!

"Hello, world! I'm Al Sweigart, author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. AMA!",2494,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/otbvoj/hello_world_im_al_sweigart_author_of_automate_the/,AlSweigart,"Howdy, y'all. I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with ""why dirt""), author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com

My latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).

""Big Book"" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another ""hello world"" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should ""work on your projects"" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told ""look at the source code of open source projects"" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.

""Beyond the Basic Stuff"" is a sort of follow up to ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.

You've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).

I got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press. I quit my software developer job in 2013 to finish writing Automate, thinking I'd get another software dev job in a year. But I kept having more ideas for other books, tutorials, videos, etc. so I'm still here writing.

Ask me anything! Post your questions and upvote questions you find interesting, and at 2pm central I'll begin replying.

EDIT (4:30pm Central) Wow, I've been typing nonstop for two and a half hours. I'm going to take a quick break and then keep going. Thanks for the questions, everyone!

EDIT 2: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm also creating a 56-video Udemy course for the Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python book as well. [So far I only have the first 15 videos done, but you can watch them on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrnLbioN6w&list=PL0-84-yl1fUmeV_2bBSguF_S0TVZk8wow)

EDIT (7:00pm) Heh, wow another two hours flew by. I'm going to drive home and then maybe answer a few more. Thanks again, everyone!

EDIT (10:30pm) Calling it a night. I'll probably answer a few more tomorrow, but I have to get back to work. Thanks again, everyone! Oh, and if you can help me out, writing an (honest) Amazon review for my books (especially the latest two) or even just sharing the links to the free online copies would be really help me get them in front of more people."

I am doing some work on a library at work, and we needed a helper script that did some analysis. The kind of program you run once and expect it to always work and be there. 
So I thought it would be a good idea to try and do it in Rust, a language that I love and know is robust and won't fail me.

However, when my supervisor saw it, I was told to please re-write it in Python because ""the next maintainer of this script probably won't know how to program in Rust"".

So no hurt feelings or anything, I 100% understand it... But I think it is a shame :(
Specially because with python you can have dependency issues, it is not portable (you need to install the libraries on each machine), it's slower, etc.

Anyhow, I tried pushing Rust at my company! 🤣🤣 I will keep trying, and maybe someday... 🥲"

I'll go first: I made a program to open my Microsoft Teams meetings when they've been scheduled to start. Literally everyone I've told about this has told me that it would be more sensible to just set an alarm.

I know there are already a lot of talented youtubers covering learning python.  I want to show how to create a python desktop application from the ground up.  It will cover specifics, not generalities and share all source code.  Here are some of the topics I plan to cover.

* focusing on Windows development, but most will port readily to linux and mac
* installing python
* sublime text editor, customizing and integrating for python
* automation scripts to aid running and building python integrated into sublime
* using pyinstaller to build executable, so you can distribute code without python
* Qt5 for building a GUI for you desktop app and using QtDesigner
* Integrating SQL database into your application (SQLite)
* my source code search for code reuse
* the target program will be a wristwatch database for my watch collection
* I will be sharing all source code
* specifics, not generalities

This will not be a ""learn how to program"" series.  The focus will be on demonstrating steps needed to build such an application.  Repurposing this watch database for your own database application would be straight forward.

Note:  There's more than one way to skin a cat .  I will simply be showing how I do it and it may or may not be the best way for you.

"Introducing JustPy: An object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming. Comes with a comprehensive tutorial",1349,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/f1qmsj/introducing_justpy_an_objectoriented_component/,eli_mintz,"# JustPy

[JustPy Docs and Tutorials](https://justpy.io)

## Introduction

JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.

Unlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.

In JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.

Custom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/html_components) and [SVG](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction) and [grids](https://justpy.io/#/grids_tutorial/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https://material.io/) components.

JustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).

JustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction).

JustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.

## Hello World!

    import justpy as jp
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
        
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

The program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or http://localhost:8000/ or  to see the result.

Here is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.

    import justpy as jp
    
    def my_click(self, msg):
        self.text = 'I was clicked!'
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        d.on('click', my_click)
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
    
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

Many other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/getting_started)

## Under the Hood

JustPy's backend is built using:

* [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) \- ""a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services"".
* [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) \- ""a lightning-fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server, built on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [httptools](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools)"".

JustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) \- ""The Progressive JavaScript Framework""

The way JustPy removes the frontend/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.

I wrote a program in Python to dodge lightning for me in FFX,667,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/15ou8qx/i_wrote_a_program_in_python_to_dodge_lightning/,MarionetteScans,"So, there was no way I actually going to try this on my own, so I wrote a bit of Python code to do the lightning bolt dodging quest for me:

    import time
    from PIL import ImageGrab
    from pynput import keyboard, mouse
    
    
    def onClick(x,y,button,pressed):
        if pressed and button == mouse.Button.left:
            getColor(x,y)
    
    def getColor(x,y):
        from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller
        keyboard = Controller()
        lightning_returns=0
        bbox=(x,y,x+10,y+10)
    
        while lightning_returns<=200:
            im=ImageGrab.grab(bbox=bbox)
            r,g,b=im.getpixel((0,0))
            if r>=60 and g>=60 and b>=60:
                lightning_returns+=1
                print(f'{lightning_returns}')
                time.sleep(0.25)
                keyboard.press(Key.enter)
                time.sleep(0.1)
                keyboard.release(Key.enter)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with mouse.Listener(on_click = onClick) as mouseListener:
                mouseListener.join()

To make sure this works properly:

1. Go stick yourself into the cactuar alcove on the first map of the Thunder Plains. 

2. Get some no encounters equipment or get yourself into no encounters mode, and stop moving.

3. Activate the code, alt tab to the game and click anywhere on screen, but preferably somewhere dark, and just let it run.

Basically, the onClick function gets Pynput to grab the coordinates of where you clicked, feeds it into the getColor function, which continually scans the location of where you clicked for its RGB values. Since the lightning flash brightens up the whole screen, at the moment when the RGB values spike, Pynput emulates the enter key press after a reasonable human reaction time delay, which is the lightning dodge button on PC.

Flatliner: turn python programs into one line of (still python) code,670,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/10ijoep/flatliner_turn_python_programs_into_one_line_of/,hhc97,"Ever wanted to turn your python program into a single line of code? No? Well now you can!

Introducing [Flatliner](https://flatliner.herokuapp.com/), a python transpiler that turns python programs into a single line of code.

# What does it do?

Put simply, it can turn python programs like:

    def func(a: int, b: int) -> str:
        result = a + b
        return f'{a} + {b} equals {result}'
    
    print(func(5, 6))

Into a single line of (still python) code, without using any ""cheats"" like semicolons and string execution:

    (lambda func: print(func(5, 6)))(lambda a, b: (lambda result: f'{a} + {b} equals {result}')((a + b)))

Running this line of code produces the same results as the original program:

    >>> (lambda func: print(func(5, 6)))(lambda a, b: (lambda result: f'{a} + {b} equals {result}')((a + b)))
    5 + 6 equals 11

# Demo!

https://reddit.com/link/10ijoep/video/a9qe9jwkhlda1/player

Demo code credits to a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/xh7ny4/spinning_cube_in_45_lines_45_chars_each/). Link to demo if you want to try it yourself: [here](https://flatliner.herokuapp.com/658daa06b199222190f1c8740d82a94d046cb813)

# How does it work?

Very briefly, it first parses the input code into an [AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html), then it converts the last node into a single line, and continuously ""wraps"" remaining nodes around this line mainly using [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) until everything becomes one line. The [source code](https://github.com/hhc97/flatliner-src/blob/master/flatline.py) is available for anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty :)

# What are it's limitations?

Unfortunately, I didn't find a way to convert every single node type into a single line. Some notable features that don't work are: try-except, ""with"" statements, del, scope modifiers like (global, nonlocal), wildcard imports, and probably a few more. ""One-lined"" code is also slower and *less readable*.

However, with the features currently implemented, it can convert a good majority of python programs without too many issues. I even managed to get a pygame application running on it (with some modifications). Notable features that *do* work are functions (including decorators), classes, loops including break and continue, assert, raise, recursion, and regular imports. The script that does the conversion can also turn itself into [one line](https://github.com/hhc97/flatliner-src/blob/master/demo/flatline_one_lined.py).

A full list of what's implemented is [here](https://github.com/hhc97/flatliner-src/blob/60300ee1a704da5468c0bd59592b85b8809cb520/flatline.py#L39-L71).

# So... what's the point of this?

Well, if you use for development:

1. code is only one line long, so easy code reviews
2. only one line to debug and breakpoint
3. job security :)

Jokes aside, it was mainly to see if it was possible. Though afterwards, I've also found it useful for obfuscation and copy-pasting python code to environments where newlines mess things up. Also useful for the occasional party trick :)

# Can I try it?

Glad you asked! I built a website for you to try it at [https://flatliner.herokuapp.com/](https://flatliner.herokuapp.com/).

When you make a submission, it'll give you a unique link to share that submission with other people if you want!

&#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope you enjoyed my project!

&#x200B;

**edit**:

Some tips on getting it to work properly.

* Loops are converted to recursive calls, so you may run into RecursionErrors with long loops. To sort of get around this, you can add this to your code:

>import sys  
>  
>sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)  # or some other number

* Functions only have access to identifiers defined above them, so the following wont work, you need to define `b()` first.

&#x200B;

    def a():
        return b()
    def b():
        return 5

Of course it will also include a basic tutorial for beginners, but I plan to include interesting challenges for all skill levels. In my day job I’m a CS professor, and this game actually started out as a tool I used in-class for my students. For the last 19 months I’ve been developing this prototype into a proper game.

Also I finally got around to recording a longer gameplay trailer, which is hot off the press and I’d like to share it with you. Please head over to the game’s Steam page where you can check it out (it’s the second video there, though I recommend watching the first teaser if you haven’t already).

I rewrote my programming language from Python into Go to see the speed up.,195,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1i1ppr7/i_rewrote_my_programming_language_from_python/,OrderOk6521,"**What my project does:**

I wrote a tree-walk interpreter in Python a while ago and posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hnfqhi/i_wrote_a_turing_complete_language_interpreter_on/).



**Target Audience:**

Python and programming entusiasts.

I was curious to see how much of a performance bump I could get by doing a 1-1 port to Go without any optimizations.

Turns out, it's around **10X** faster, plus now I can create compiled binaries and include them in my Github releases.

Take my [lang for a spin](https://github.com/momus2000/boa) and leave some feedback :)

  
**Utility:**

None - It solves no practical problem that is not currently being done better."
I made a site that randomly generates python practice programs to teach reading fluency,2300,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ibcq42/i_made_a_site_that_randomly_generates_python/,palpalpalwarp,"I've been a programming tutor for about 7 years, and I only recently realized that a major weakness in the way programming is taught is that beginners don't get to practice reading code enough to be able to read *quickly*. I made this site to randomly generate python programs for the user to read and figure out the output. It can be configured based on your level of ability, e.g. you can include or exclude different variable types and the difficulty levels gradually introduce more complex statements, if/elif/else, loops, and nested loops. There are three different exercises currently: control flow, boolean expressions, and functions.

I've been using this with one of my students and it seems to have helped. He certainly got faster at reading code, and I think the skill has transferred over to writing code as well.

Here's the link to the control flow exercise: [https://trprt.io/python-practice-problems-ifs-loops-control-flow](https://trprt.io/python-practice-problems-ifs-loops-control-flow)

I made a reactive programming library for Python,218,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gealvf/i_made_a_reactive_programming_library_for_python/,mercer22,"Hey all!

I recently published a reactive programming library called `signified`.

You can find it here:

* Source - https://github.com/dougmercer/signified/
* Docs - https://dougmercer.github.io/signified/
* PyPI - https://pypi.org/project/signified/

# What my project does

## What is reactive programming?

Good question!

The short answer is that it's a programming paradigm that focuses on reacting to change. When a reactive object changes, it notifies any objects observing it, which gives those objects the chance to update (which could in turn lead to them changing and notifying their observers...)

## Can I see some examples?

Sure!

### Example 1

    from signified import Signal
    
    a = Signal(3)
    b = Signal(4)
    c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
    print(c)  # <5>

    a.value = 5
    b.value = 12
    print(c)  # <13>


Here, `a` and `b` are Signals, which are reactive containers for values.

In `signified`, reactive values like Signals overload a lot of Python operators to make it easier to make reactive expressions using the operators you're already familiar with. Here, `c` is a reactive expression that is the solution to the pythagorean theorem (`a ** 2 + b ** 2 = c ** 2`)

We initially set the values for `a` and `b` to be 3 and 4, so `c` initially had the value of 5. However, because `a`, `b`, and `c` are reactive, after changing the values of `a` and `b` to 5 and 12, `c` automatically updated to have the value of 13.

### Example 2

    from signified import Signal, computed
    
    x = Signal([1, 2, 3])
    sum_x = computed(sum)(x)
    print(x)  # <[1, 2, 3]>
    print(sum_x)  # <6>
    
    x[1] = 4
    print(x)  # <[1, 4, 3]>
    print(sum_x)  # <8>

Here, we created a signal `x` containing the list `[1, 2, 3]`. We then used the `computed` decorator to turn the `sum` function into a function that produces reactive values, and passed `x` as the input to that function.

We were then able to update `x` to have a different value for its second item, and our reactive expression `sum_x` automatically updated to reflect that.

# Target Audience

# Why would I want this?

I was skeptical at first too... it adds a lot of complexity and a bit of overhead to what would otherwise be simple functions.

However, reactive programming is very popular in the front-end web dev and user interface world for a reason-- it often helps make it easy to specify the relationship between things in a more declarative way.

The main motivator for me to create this library is because I'm also working on an animation library. (It's not open sourced yet, but I made a video on it here pre-refactor to reactive programming https://youtu.be/Cdb_XK5lkhk). So far, I've found that adding reactivity has solved more problems than it's created, so I'll take that as a win.

## Status of this project

This project is still in its early stages, so consider it ""in beta"".

Now that it'll be getting in the hands of people besides myself, I'm definitely excited to see how badly you can break it (or what you're able to do with it). Feel free to create issues or submit PRs on GitHub!

# Comparison

Why not use an existing library?

The `param` library from the Holoviz team features reactive values. It's great! However, their library isn't type hinted.

Personally, I get frustrated working with libraries that break my IDE's ability to provide completions. So, essentially for that reason alone, I made `signified`.

`signified` is mostly type hinted, except in cases where Python's type system doesn't really have the necessary capabilities.

Unfortunately, the type hints currently only work in `pyright` (not `mypy`) because I've abused the type system quite a bit to make the type narrowing work. I'd like to fix this in the future...

# Where to find out more

Check out any of those links above to get access to the code, or check out my YouTube video discussing it here https://youtu.be/nkuXqx-6Xwc . There, I go into detail on how it's implemented and give a few more examples of why reactive programming is so cool for things like animation.

Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions!

It looks like Algorand has taken to heart these criticisms and is addressing them in 2024. These changes have me very excited for the future and I'm glad Algorand has listened to the community at large. When incentives are aligned correctly it creates a culture and ethos of decentralization that underpins why we're all here. Self-sovereignty and the power to be our own bank. No matter who you are or where you're from, trust is not needed, we can transact with others across the globe, without knowing or speaking the same language. This is democratized global finance, the idea that we do not need to rely on centralized and corrupt banking corporations to steal our money or central banks to inflate our currency is why Bitcoin was invented and is why I'm here and I'm sure why many of you are here too. This is the ethos and philosophy of crypto. It's not just about moon shots and gambling, it's about fundamentally changing the financial system for the better.

Below is the full Algorand Road map of 2024. Algorand has surely made some mistakes, but this road map proves to me that they have listened and learned and they truly do want to create one of the fastest, cheapest, most robust decentralized networks in existence. Who is ready to earn ALGO running nodes? I AM!

MIT offers free online course in Computer Programming using Python,1157,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/neg3hb/mit_offers_free_online_course_in_computer/,ivaylos,"***The course offered by MIT is an introduction to Computer Science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5***

Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT), one of the most premium technical educational institutes in the world, has recently announced a free online course in Computer Programming using Python. The course is available on the edX e-learning platform and the registrations are open until June 2. Here are the course details.

**About course**

The course is named "" **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming** **using Python**"". The objective of this course is to provide learners with a brief introduction to many computer programming concepts so as to give them an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, this is not a ""computation appreciation"" course but a challenging and rigorous learning path on which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

Python is the most sought-after programming language skill by IT professionals and the demand for skilled Python developers is also very high in the job market. In this course, learners will be taught the nuances of programming using Python 3.5.

**Course format**

The class will consist of lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets using Python 3.5. The lecture videos are broken into small pieces usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated ""check-yourself"" questions. Even if you have knowledge of Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in this course. There will also be programming assignments and standalone exams/quizzes, which are not part of the video lectures.

**What is in it for learners**

* A Notion of computation
* The Python programming language
* Some simple algorithms
* Testing and debugging
* An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
* Data structures

**Course instructors**

The course is instructed by 3 MIT professors:

* John Guttag, Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at MIT
* Eric Grimson, Bernard Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering, Professor of Computer Science at MIT
* Ana Bell, Lecturer, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at MIT

**System requirements**

You need to have a computer running one of the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows, version XP or greater (XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7)Apple OSX, version 10.2 or greater.

Linux - most distributions that have been released within the past two years should work

In addition, you will need the ability to download, install, and run software on your computer.

**Other important details**

* This is an instructor-paced course; however, students can watch the lectures at their leisure and do not need to watch the lectures live or at any set time.
* The course starts on June 2 and will end on August 5. So, you are required to enrol before June 2.
* The course is free.

**How to enrol**

To enrol in this program, you can visit the [MITx course page on edX here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7).

I work in a company that implements AI, data science, APIs and whatever they ask for. Being few and the only one who does Python things, I do whatever the project of that month is. Nobody tells me if things are right or wrong and they usually end up working correctly but I feel like they are not professional results.

I studied mathematics, where they don't teach any programming, and I learned through YouTube videos and courses like datacamp or freecodeacademy. I was lucky enough to get a job and I am learning while working according to the project. From time to time I find a bug in the opensource libraries and I manage to make PRs and there are no complaints about my code. But I have to invest some time in understanding how the libraries are programmed since they use concepts and abstractions that if I had done so, I would not have approached them that way.

I would like to know if you can recommend me any course or book (I usually prefer books) that will help me to approach big projects, how I should structure them, how to use class abstractions, how to do a correct validation, how to do a good logging. I would also appreciate recommendations on how the language works internally or any source to help me become a better programmer.  
Most of the courses I find on the internet or books explain me basic concepts of the language syntax but I already know how to write it, I have a lack of basic knowledge of the language.

Most courses I find on the internet or books explain basic concepts of the language syntax but I already know how to write it, I have a lack of basis of the ""theory"" of programming, data structures, etc.. And how to approach a large project in a way that is scalable in the future.

**If knowledge were a line from 0 to 10, I am in the range 3 to 7 and I don't know how to expand into the other directions.**

**TL/DR: I know how to program in python but I don't know the theory of programming. I would like to learn the basics of programming and how to approach large projects, abstractions and so on.**

EDIT: Currently trying to make good use of the abc library. Any resources around this subjects greatly appreciated too.

I want to teach my 13 year old programming. He has the mind for it as he is very logical like his dad. Is Python a good choice? Or is there something else that would be better?,486,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/mv69n5/i_want_to_teach_my_13_year_old_programming_he_has/,vawksel,"I want to teach my 13 year old son programming. What is the best language with the easiest with fastest results today?  Is Python a good choice?

I learned programming in BASIC on the Atari then AMIGA Basic and Q-Basic (Gorilla etc) back in the 1980's and 1990's.  It was a lot of fun, but these days BASIC isn't really around anymore, and there are probably much better choices to begin with.  Over the decades I've done C/C++/ObjC/x86asm/Java/Go-lang/Ruby and a few others, but I'm fairly new to Python however it is easy for me to pick up. 

1) Is Python is a good choice to teach him?  What gaming framework or libraries should we use?  It seems like Python has very good readablity and syntax for a young mind to grasp.  

2) If not Python, what do you guys think instead?  

3) I learned by modifying existing games in BASIC instead of writing things from scratch.  I would change a few variables, numbers, etc and see how that changed the game.  Is there an existing Python game we should modify?  Or should we start with the basics, e.g. Hello World. ... Ask for the player name or age, do some basic math... then load up some sprites on the screen and move them around?

He wants to make Minecraft Mods at some point but I believe from my experience, that it is too tall of an order to begin with.  So looking for a much simpler platform to create some basic 2D games with.

Finally, I want to add we are not in the same physical location.  So we will be using Discord for voice chat and likely Teamviewer for screen sharing.  If you have any suggestions around this, e.g. something better than teamviewer, please let me know.

Thank you for all your ideas!"

Thank you!  In case you missed it, the game is all about practicing and applying your Python skills to challenging tasks in realistic, physically simulated 3D environments. It covers a wide variety of topics, from basic algo / ds, oop, GUI programming to control theory, robotics, image processing, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and more. Development is well underway and I'm aiming for a release in Q4 this year.

Today I'd like to get your thoughts on the importance of debugging! Obviously, I already spent an unreasonable amount of time solving the problem, before talking to stakeholders :). So I did create a custom Python debugger (using sys.settrace) and hooked it up to my in-game GUI (based on Codemirror). Now you can set breakpoints, step through the code and inspect variables like you are used to - and the game / simulation steps along in sync (mostly).

If you are interested in the game, you can find a lot more information about this and all other features and an up to date devlog on the Steam page:

Here is the link to the repo: [https://github.com/manoss96/pregex](https://github.com/manoss96/pregex)

Any feedback is welcome!

**UPDATE:** Thank you all for your comments and feedback, I hope this package helps you get the job done faster! I've gotten a lot of comments mentioning that having to import every stuff is annoying, and I can understand that. However, I still think that all classes should remain separated into different modules, as each module expresses a different functionality, but at the same time I don't think that importing everything all at once is a good thing, so I tried a different approach. All the modules that you'll need are now imported within the package's ""\_\_init\_\_.py"" by using a short alias for each module. For instance, ""[quantifiers.py](https://quantifiers.py)"" is imported as ""qu"". Thus, you can simply write ""from pregex import \*"" at the top of your .py script, and then just use these aliases. Just be careful, this can only be done in pregex version >=1.0.2."
First month of programming in python and I don't understand anything,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gaqdg4/first_month_of_programming_in_python_and_i_dont/,Queasy_Price3105,"It's my first time programming, and I don't know how people do this. I don't understand how to think like a programmer, and I don't know what to write. Tell me something, and I can't do it, but if you show me the code, I can read it well.  I'm struggling a lot and even worse I have only like 1 hr of time for programming.  If python is the easiest language how will the others be? Is it just more or is it more of a universal experience?"

Should I take Python or C++ class as my first programming course?,9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5cgkq,TheLastMorsel,"Hello, I will be taking my first computer science class this semester and I’m wondering if I should begin with Intro to Programming: Python or skip that and start Computer Science 1: C++. 

The former does not count towards my degree but since I nothing about programming, I was thinking maybe it could serve as a prerequisite. Some people have advised me to skip the intro class because of how easy it is. Others have suggested I take it since I am an absolute beginner. 

Regardless of which class I take, it will be in addition to Calculus 2 and Physics 1. If I end up taking intro to python, I would take an additional fourth class. If I skip to C++, I’ll probably just take three classes this upcoming semester.

Any advice would be appreciated."

"I just had a ""clap-along"". I had no idea this is how they tested entry-level.",3170,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1df6nro/i_just_had_a_clapalong_i_had_no_idea_this_is_how/,OutrageousPressure6,"I just had my first interview (yup! very happy, after like 12 months of searching!). It was over zoom, and it was with my would-be supervisor (director of engineering) and the director of marketing, and one other person, not even sure who they were though. 

I knew it wouldn't be a very difficult interview cause it's with a very small non-tech company in my state, and the position would be doing web development for our clients and partners. Anyways, the recruiter just told me that ""entry-level CS knowledge would suffice""

So after talking about myself for 5-10 minutes, the director of engineering said ""are you ready for the technical part of the interview""

Me: ""Sure""

Him: ""Don't worry we don't like to have candidates stress. We just want someone that is motivated and willing to learn.""

Me: ""Awesome, that sounds great.""

Him: ""Okay, now I want you to ""clap"" when the right answer is read aloud, okay?""

Me: ""Okay"" \*thinking, okay did I hear that right? That's strange\*

Him: ""First question. Which tool is used for styling a webpage? A.) HTML, B.) Javascript, C.) Django, or D.) CSS""

Me: \*claps when I hear CSS\*

Him: ""Great! Next question: API stands for A.) ""App Programming Initiative"", B.) ""Angular Programming Interface"", C.) ""Application Programming Interface""

Me: \*claps when I hear the correct option for API""

Him: ""Excellent!!! You're one of the best candidates we've had so far!""

Me: \*trying not to laugh\* ""thank you!""

  
So basically, yeah the interview was just that for like, 10 minutes (the questions were legit mostly that easy, yes, with a couple questions asking what a particular paradigm or basic python function might do). 

  
So yeah, has anyone ever had a clap-along interview before or just me?"
The Mojo Programming Language: A Python Superset Drawing from Rust's Strengths,224,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1380uk0/the_mojo_programming_language_a_python_superset/,wicked_lama,"**""Mojo is a programming language that is as easy to use as Python but with the performance of C++ and Rust. Furthermore, Mojo provides the ability to leverage the entire Python library ecosystem. ""**

[https://www.modular.com/mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)

Some quotes I found interesting (from the [Mojo🔥 programming manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/programming-manual.html)):

>Mojo also supports the \_\_moveinit\_\_ method, which allows both Rust-style moves (which take a value when a lifetime ends) and C++-style moves.  
>  
>...  
>  
>the Mojo compiler uses dataflow analysis and type annotations to provide full control over value copies, aliasing of references, and mutation control. The features provided are similar in many ways to what the Rust language provides, but they work somewhat differently in order to make Mojo easier to learn and integrate better into the Python ecosystem without requiring a massive annotation burden.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Rust is another important language and the Mojo and Rust borrow checkers enforce the same exclusivity invariants. The major difference between Rust and Mojo is that no sigil is required on the caller side to pass by borrow, Mojo is more efficient when passing small values, and Rust defaults to moving values by default instead of passing them around by borrow. These policy and syntax decisions allow Mojo to provide an easier to use programming model.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Mojo does internally have an equivalent of the Rust “[mem::forget](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.forget.html)” function, which explicitly disables a destructor and has a corresponding internal feature for “blessing” an object, but they aren’t exposed for user consumption at this point.

Personally I am really excited about this, given Rust's relatively young age, it's amazing to already see its influence on an even younger, higher-level language.

I'm a software engineer looking for beginners to pair program on algorithms in Python,1074,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ltngms/im_a_software_engineer_looking_for_beginners_to/,TravisJungroth,"Edit: I'm completely booked! 42 sessions in the next week. If you'd like to know when I'm doing more sessions, [send me your email](https://airtable.com/shrh7vuWeXKjmEH0L).

Hi everyone, I'm a software engineer with fiveish years of experience. I'm working on leveling up my algorithm skills, and I'm looking for beginner programmers to pair program with in [Strong Style](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#Strong-stylePairing). You'll be typing the code, but I'll be ""writing"" the code by giving instructions. The instructions will be as high level as possible, but if there's something you don't understand we'll just drop down to very detailed.

Beginners welcome! The minimum amount of knowledge for us to be productive will just be having done one Python book/tutorial/course. If you can follow the instructions ""Make a list of 1, 2, 3 and save it to x"", then you're good. More experience is welcome, of course.

Why am I doing this? I'm one of those rare breed of extrovert software engineers. I get more energy from interacting with other people and that's kinda hard to do while studying. I also think it will help beginners [and](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i9vuhr/i_wrote_a_syllabus_for_learning_python_and_django/) [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i0kld3/how_students_get_themselves_into_tutorial_hell/) [like](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ibt0ni/im_looking_to_mentor_someone_who_wants_to_become/) [doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/chile/comments/gdxuf0/want_to_learn_to_how_to_code_im_a_software/) [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/fm0ip2/im_a_software_engineer_looking_to_better/).

If this sounds cool, book something on my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/travisjungroth/pair-programming-algorithms-45-minutes). Or, I'll be happy to answer any questions."
"Which other programming language best complements Python - Rust, Go, or something else?",245,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/wfxoxx/which_other_programming_language_best_complements/,Salty_Bicycle,"I want to learn another language that focuses on performance to complement my Python (Django) code. My aim is to perform some tasks on those languages by calling their functions from within Python.

I have tried a bit of Go + Python and it felt simple enough to implement. How does Rust fare in this regard? Should I fully commit to learning Go or switch to Rust? Any other suggestions are also welcome."
My mom offered to pay for a python/programming course - should i take it or try to learn myself?,477,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/maqihc/my_mom_offered_to_pay_for_a_pythonprogramming/,FanGothic2,"This morning my mom called me and told me that her friend's son took part in (not a cheap one) a python course and now he has a well-paid job. I wanted to learn python myself but i kind of don't have time right now( bachelor thesis).

So I wanted to ask, is this a waste of money? Or more like - should I accept my mom's offer or it's not worth it and try to learn python myself?

I study finance so I have probability and statistics and I'm gonna have c++ and python in the next semester if that matters

EDIT: Okay that was my bad i shouldn't have said that i have bachelor thesis: the offer still stands after i finish writing it."
"I massively updated my python program that allows local LLMs running via llama.cpp to look things up on the internet, it now fully web scrapes the most relevant results!",237,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fhaqjg/i_massively_updated_my_python_program_that_allows/,CuriousAustralianBoy,"Hey there if you saw my previous post thanks! I have been hard at work finally I have managed to achieve updating the repo on github with the new version which fully web scrapes after selecting the top results to answer a user's question to the LLM, the LLM picks the search query, then selects the 2 most relevant results out of 10 from that query. 

Then it will get a bunch of info from those results and will either decide to conduct further searches or it will then answer the User's question. This update took countless hours, I really hope its an improvement! Also updated the program to have an llm\_config.py file which allows you to change the llama.cpp settings AND use your GPU for the program if your llama.cpp is built with GPU support enabled!

"If I don't want a career in programming, is it better for me to learn Python than anything else?",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbf1o2/if_i_dont_want_a_career_in_programming_is_it/,deDICKated,"I am not looking for a career in programming but I think it's a very important skill to have. Whether it's because I want to develop codes for myself for ease of life or any business purposes etc.. etc.. 

But I am someone who tends to master what I get involved in. I know the common question is c++ or Python, but for someone in my position who doesn't want a career in programming, is learning c++ worth the time involved?

I'm completely new to coding but I'm quite technical so I'm not that lack luster.

I'd be eager to learn.

Advice is appreciated thank you.

Any suggestion?"
That time I optimized a Python program by 5000x,891,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/s1oqb7/that_time_i_optimized_a_python_program_by_5000x/,emeryberger,"*TL;DR I used our Scalene profiler (pip install scalene) and some math to make an example program run 5000x faster.*

I am quite interested in Python performance so naturally I read this article — [https://martinheinz.dev/blog/64](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/64), whose title is *Profiling and Analyzing Performance of Python Programs.* It presents an example program from the Python documentation ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html)) and shows how to run it with several time-worn Python profilers. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come away with much actionable information, beyond, more or less, “try [*PyPy*](https://www.pypy.org/)””, which speeds up the code by about 2x. I wondered if I would be able to get more useful information from Scalene, a profiler I co-wrote.

[Scalene: https:\/\/github.com\/plasma-umass\/scalene\/, pip install scalene](https://preview.redd.it/cg4u621qp4b81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9aaf92125523801c12bbef4fc1f649cc499da3e)

We developed Scalene to be a lot more useful than existing Python profilers: it provides line-level information, splits out Python from native time, profiles memory usage, GPU, and even copying costs, all at a line granularity.

Anyway, here’s the result of running Scalene (just with CPU profiling) on the example code. It really cuts to the chase.

    % scalene --cpu-only --reduced-profile test/test-martinheinz.py

https://preview.redd.it/j1yhxptvp4b81.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bc8d25415fc8ac25a8f7da3031299a724fa02cf

You can see that practically all the execution time is spent computing the ratio between num and fact, so really this is the only place to focus any optimization efforts. The fact that there is a lot of time spent running native code means that this line is executing some C library under the covers.

It turns out that it is dividing two `Decimal`s (a.k.a. [bignums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic)). The underlying bignum library is written in C code and is pretty fast, but the factorial in particular is getting really large really fast. In one of the example inputs, the final value of `fact` is 11,000 digits long! No surprise: doing math on such huge numbers is expensive. Let’s see what we can do to make those numbers smaller.

I observe that we can compute `num / fact` not from scratch but incrementally: update a variable on each loop iteration via a computation on drastically smaller numbers. To do this, I add a new variable `nf` which will always equal the ratio `num / fact`. Then, on each loop iteration, the program updates `nf` by multiplying it by `x / i.` You can verify this maintains the invariant `nf == num/fact` by observing the following (where `_new` means the computation of the updated variable in each iteration).

    nf == num / fact                  # true by induction
    nf_new == nf * (x / i)            # we multiply by x/i each time
    nf_new == (num / fact) * (x / i)  # definition of nf
    nf_new == (num * x) / (fact * i)  # re-arranging
    nf_new == num_new / fact_new      # simplifying

Incorporating this into the original program required changing three lines of code, all of which are followed by ###:

    def exp_opt(x):
      getcontext().prec += 2
      i, lasts, s, fact, num = 0, 0, 1, 1, 1
      nf = Decimal(1)   ### was: = num / fact
      while s != lasts:
          lasts = s
          i += 1
          fact *= i
          num *= x
          nf *= (x / i) ### update nf to be num / fact
          s += nf       ### was: s += num / fact
      getcontext().prec -= 2
      return +s

The result of this change is, uh, *dramatic*.

More than a *5000X* speedup (5096, to be precise).

The moral of the story is that using a more detailed profiler like Scalene can really help optimization efforts by locating inefficiencies in an actionable way."
I asked the GPT-3 AI to write a python program to find a solution to an image of a maze. It worked.,438,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/uu3tl0/i_asked_the_gpt3_ai_to_write_a_python_program_to/,fredandlunchbox,"I provided the following prompt to the GPT-3 AI:

Load an image of a maze from the file ""maze.png"". It will meet the description of the maze above.
Analyze the image to find a solution to the maze. Use the a* pathfinding algorithm.

update 11/17/24

a huge thank you to everyone that has upvoted/commented/starred/... this project, it's my first ever open source project and i feel loved by the community. i've been doing some key updates that i think should greatly improve user experience. and i've got the cuda version code filled in and tested!

here's a list of todos that i've crossed in the last few days

*  CUDA QLoRA support 
* Windows support (now only tested on Mac)
*  Filter out spam ads emails by using replied rate (or is there some API for this?)
*  A configurable list of senders to ignore (e.g., [no-reply@example.com](mailto:no-reply@example.com))

for anyone trying this project out, i'd appreciate if you gave me any kind of feedback on how to improve it.

thinking about a few things:

1. is it possible to pack this into an exec that ppl can just run? ideally with a super simple and tiny gui they can interact with
2. any interest in one-key voice-based rewrite? this might be harder to set up because users might be using different email clients and it's hard to know the proper thread that they're in..
3. how do i make the README look better, w/ visuals and useful stats icons?

\------------------original post------------------

i've seen similar ideas/products like this here and there but some of them need subscriptions and pass along your data to openai and some of them are just not intuitive to set up or too complicated to use.

**tldr**: you can open any unread email with an already drafted response that sounds like you, and hit send..!

**magic behind the scenes**:

1. it goes thru your gmail sent box, extract the conversation (what other ppl sent and what you replied) and organize them into prompt-completion pairs.
2. it fine tunes the model of your choice locally
3. once the bot is set up and running, it iteratively checks your gmail for unread emails and draft a response for you so that you can open the thread and see it directly.

i'd love to further request suggestions on a few technical details:

1. right now everything's in python and the user needs to set up their google cloud credentials, is there a way for me to convert this to an app that can just ask their permission using my credentials (assuming they trust me), and still let everything runs and stays on their computer? i just need to access their gmail using the gmail api in python locally, which requires auth somehow..
2. right now i've only tested it on mac, so if someone found this interesting and uses a pc feel free to contribute. it's intended to be also working w/ cuda gpus.

a lot more to optimize for but i find it super handy and just want to share it first ;) i'm a rookie in devs so any feedback is welcomed!"

Python professor doesn’t know Python or how to program…,325,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b3oj36,DocNeuroscientist,So I’m taking a Python for Math and Statistics class at the University of Colorado at Boulder and my boyfriend who is a software engineer has been urging me to take the class more seriously since the beginning of the semester.

Among my other complaints is the fact that the professor didn’t even inform us that there were other coding options than the stupid web based Anaconda interface the syllabus tells us to use.

Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!,10602,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kn41qn/learn_python_with_fantasy_football_giveaway/,NukishPhilosophy,"Hi all,

[I recently created a course on learning Python with Fantasy Football for complete beginners.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com)

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football. 

The overall goal of my course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. A lot of people have reported back to me that this course was the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after going through countless udemy courses and e-books. I don't think that's because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great ones out there, especially on YouTube (Brad Traversy, Cody Schafer, etc). I think it's because the best, fastest, and most pleasant way to learn to code is to apply it to something you enjoy and can be useful to you right away. For example, most beginner machine learning with Python courses introduce you to predictive analysis by having you predict housing prices. That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to get introduced to predictive analysis by predicting WR fantasy football performance? 

With this in mind, each section of my course has some sort of fantasy football focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. My course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to rank players in to tiers for fantasy football. It comes with 16 sections of material, 14 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I work from home, so I usually respond within a couple minutes to 2 days max).

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content [since my first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/en8xte/guide_to_setting_up_python_for_fantasy_football/), so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season! 

**Just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select three people to get free lifetime access to the course.**

Edit:

I'll make the selection at 10PM EST tonight and post the results at the bottom here. If you win, I'll also be sending you a PM on how to access the course!

Also, some people already ordered. If you want to order it already that's cool, you'll get a full refund if you're randomly selected by the draw. You'll just have to let me know after what email you used at checkout.

I actually think the reason is because the best and most engaging way to learn to code is through subject matters that interest you. For example, a lot of beginner data science courses start you out by predicting housing prices.  That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to introduce you to predictive analysis by teaching you to make a model to predict the NBA MVP this season? 

With this in mind, each section of the course has some sort of basketball/NBA focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. The course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to predict points scored for the season for certain players, predict who will be MVP, and rank players into tiers for fantasy basketball. It comes with 10 sections of material, 8 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I'm on Slack all day so I usually respond pretty quickly).

Anyway, the mods ok'd it, so I figured id do a giveaway - **just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course) 10 people to get free lifetime access to the course after the Nuggets game tonight.** (Will select more if a lot of people enter)

For the longest time, he only talked about space/multi verse/planets/galaxies/force fields/black holes etc. Then it was games and I wasnt too happy about that because it seemed to just make his head race alot and its not very useful for him. One day we talked about hackers and I told him to stop downloading nonsense on phones and he told me he was downloading apps to keep the phone secure. He was deleting files and blocking all permissions to keep the phone secure. Anyway the conversation took off and then I told him to learn programming to stop future hackers. I showed him a couple of vids on youtube (intro to programming) and hes been watching Python videos ever since. The thing is, these videos on youtube have part 1, part 2 etc. Once he finishes the videos, its not like he learned the whole language. Its like they are incomplete. Not full lessons. They are short vids. What resources can I give him, a channel he can follow so that he can really learn and pick up the programming language fully and properly? I was thinking about getting him a computer so he can follow with the videos as they write codes so he can use the softwares too. I dont think there any good games for kids to learn coding. I just dont know how to let his interest grow and which channels actually teach coding fully. Hes only 7 and can have a bright future with this."

I need to do something I've never needed to do before. Normally, I just make a python it runs, does its thing, and exits. However for reasons that are not important I need a python script to stay running and receive arguments via the Linux command line. Staying running is trivial of course what I've never done before is have a python script receive commands the shell after it has already started.

What would be the easiest way to listen for a call from the command line and process the arguments?

Performance is a non-issue, looking for simple. This server does nothing except run a website and when something happens on the website asks the script to do something.

I'm 26 years old and from Germany. Today I want to start my programming journey in Python, I want to learn the basics and then realize a project I already have on my mind.

For everyone who wants to start as well, do it like me and just start. I set myself the minimum requirement of coding at least 10 minutes per day (that's a trap for my brain, when I already started it is more like for me to code way more then 10 minutes).

I already downloaded Atom, Python and I selected the book ""automate the boring stuff with python"" as my main literature. Now I have to read the manual of Atom and get familiar with it, the only thing I've done so far. I'll try to keep you updated everyday, I is not important if anyone follows this.

My first Python program - Fifty years in the making!,731,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/irytd1/my_first_python_program_fifty_years_in_the_making/,tuffdadsf,"Hello everyone!

I am a seasoned SQL programmer/reporting expert who's been working in Radiology for the past 20+ years. I had always wanted to learn another programming language and had many starts and stops in my road to that end. I was able to understand the process of programming but never really pushed myself to have any real work/world applications to try it out on.

So for my 50th birthday I made a promise to myself that this would be the year that I actually learn Python and create a program. I started with the ""Automate The Boring Stuff"" course and then figured out what problem I wanted to solve.

Once a month I have to collect test results on the monitors that the radiologist use to read imaging (xrays) on. The Dept of Health says we need to be sure the monitors are up to snuff and we have proof that this testing is happening. Normally I would have to click through a bunch of web pages to get to a collection of PDFs (that are created on the fly)  that contain the test results. Then I'd have to save the file and move it to the appropriate directory on a server. Very manual and probably takes 30 minutes or so to get all the reports.

It took a bit of time but my Google Fu is strong so I was (for the most part) able to find the answers I needed to keep moving forward. I posted a few problems to Stack Overflow when I was really stumped.

The end result is the code below which does the whole process in about a minute. I am so proud of myself getting it to work and now I have this extra boost of confidence towards the other jobs I plan to automate.

I also wanted to post this because some of the solutions were hard to find and I hope if another programmer hits the same snag they could find it in a Google search and use part of my code to fix theirs.

I'm on fire and have so many more new projects I can't wait to create!

It does this by looping through each column of pixels, assessing how close in colour each pixel is to the last pixel. If they are deemed to be similar in colour then they will be changed to the same colour as the last pixel now is, however if they are not - they will be changed to a different colour (eg. if the last pixel was made red, then this one will be green or blue). It completes this process for the entire image, making every pixel in the image red, green, or blue - not overly sure I like the effect but it was a fun experiment.

I’m a teacher: help me choose a Python project to teach high-schoolers programming,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/i7mmyh/im_a_teacher_help_me_choose_a_python_project_to/,Sh4rPEYE,"A little deviation from the “How to learn programming” posts — I’d like to hear how should I *teach* programming, instead.

## TLDR

I’ll have around 10 students who all now the basics of Python. I’d like to continue their education by assigning them a project that they will work on for the whole year, each week a different part (imagine: testing, architecture, source control...). The lectures themselves would be mainly discussions about that week’s topic. 

What do you think the projects should be? What kind of project would you like to do as a student? And what input from the teacher would you appreciate the most?

## Details

The class isn’t a compulsory and will be taught every week (90 minutes). There will be around 10 eighteen-year-olds which all have one-year experience with Python (i.e. they know the basics: loops, functions, datatypes etc), most of them wanting to continue their education at a university in CS or related field.

I think the best way for them to continue their foray into programming would be to do a large project that would help me demonstrate the more advanced programming concepts like architecture, testing, and model design, and also some of the things closely related to commom programming work, like build tools, git, and basics of command-line.

My current idea is to group them to teams of two or three people and let the teams choose a project from a small selection of related projects. During the year they’ll be working on different parts of the project, with the lectures being filled mostly with discussion about that weeks’ “task” and maybe a short presentation on the topic by me. I’d also like to give detailed feedback on the code during the year (that’s the reason I want three teams rather than 10 individuals).

Do you think it’s a good approach to a programming course? And if so, which projects do you think would fit, considering they ought to be “iterative” in nature (so that we can split them up to parts), interesting and should demonstrate some common programming patterns?"

Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!,3721,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/s67clq/learn_python_with_fantasy_football_giveaway/,NukishPhilosophy,"Hi everyone,

This is the second giveaway I'm doing for a course I teach on learning Python with Fantasy Football!

**[Link to the course](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/)**

**Upvote and comment anything below to enter! Winners will be randomly chosen after the Rams-Cardinals game tonight** 

Below is what I wrote last year when I did this same giveaway with a brief description of what the course is about, why I made it, and what makes it different than your average programming course (the feedback last year was so amazing with close to 5000 entries that we're doing 10 winners this year):

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football.

The overall goal of the course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. A lot of people have reported back to me that this course was the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after going through countless udemy courses and e-books. I don't think that's because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great educators out there, especially on YouTube (Brad Traversy, Cody Schafer, etc). I think it's because the best, fastest, and most enjoyable way to learn to code is to apply it to something you enjoy and can be useful to you right away. For example, most beginner machine learning with Python courses introduce you to predictive analysis by having you predict housing prices. That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to get introduced to predictive analysis by predicting WR fantasy football performance?

With this in mind, each section of my course has some sort of fantasy football focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. My course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to rank players in to tiers for your draft. It comes with 16 sections of material, 14 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck.

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content since my first ever post here, so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season!

Just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course :)) ten people to get free lifetime access to the course.

Just as last year, I'll make the selection tonight and post the results at the bottom here. If you win, I'll also be sending you a PM on how to access the course!

Also, some people will want to order before the giveaway is over. If you want to order it already that's cool, you'll get a full refund if you're randomly selected by the draw. You'll just have to let me know after what email you used at checkout.

**Winners are posted below. Thank you to everyone who participated in the giveaway!!**
