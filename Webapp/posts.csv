Have the Trump supporters around you gotten quiet?,SteveinTenn,Mine have suddenly lost interest in discussing politics. Or egg prices. Or wars. As the inauguration nears they’ve pretty much gone silent and deep. We got one day of “God gave us Trump back!” then nothing. Especially as the cabinet nominees have been announced. 
"Conservatives, are you excited about Donald Trump taking office?",MsMcSlothyFace,"Do you believe he will fix inflation, immigration, housing crisis, etc? Are you a trump supporter (maga) or did you vote for him solely because he was the republican candidate?"

Trump has won. Here’s what we do now:,Leksi_The_Great,"At this point, it’s over. Our discussion should be solely on what we can do from here given our new grim reality. 

1. It’s alright to cry, and to feel scared for what’s to come. We should give ourselves a few days to grieve what we, or at least I, thought the United States was.

2. Update all your ID documents NOW, if you can. A Trump-controlled executive branch will place all sorts of restrictions on us, and the FDA might restrict our HRT. Legally female individuals will not have trouble accessing that medication. If you are in any state but Tennessee, Montana, Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma, this is still something you can do. Doing this will make you safe from any laws that could be made to target the trans community. I live in Texas, but was born in California, so I’m going to start the name and gender change process in the next few days. Do everything: name, gender, passport, driver’s license, and any other ID you might have.

3. Make plans to move to a blue state. The hate is going to get unprecedented in the next four years. Blue states will still be great states to live in, and they will continue to be safe for us no matter what Trump tries. You can also explore moving to a country like Canada if you have the option.

4. We will not back down. We’ve fought so hard for the rights and visibility we have now. We will not lose it. We will never give up.

To all my sisters here who are also worried, I send you hugs <3"

Trump won. Here’s what we do next.
",TemporaryMagician,"I know this was not the outcome that we hoped for. Patriarchy fucking struck back last night in the US, and I know a lot of us are not ok this morning. We are hurt, disappointed, and lost.



Here’s what we do: take a few minutes and feel our feelings, maybe listen to a sad song or two, and cry it out. 



Then, we go to work. Literally, we go to our jobs and make some money. We go to the gym. Lift weights. Get in our walk or run. Eat nourishing food. Plant a seed or water a houseplant.  Check on our friends and loved ones, especially if they’re queer or not white. Give our pets an extra treat today. Reach out to our friends and loved ones if we are struggling. 



Because we need to survive. We have to be strong for the next few years. I don’t know what those will look like, but what I do know is that we all have people depending on us. We need to be healthy, and we need to have funds. Take your anger, and let it fuel you to be someone who can endure, and shelter others who need it, for the next four years. Our trans friends need us. Our black friends need us. Our queer friends, our young friends, our international friends, they need us to have their backs.



Remember, we are witches. We are the poison ivy that you thought you uprooted last year but pops back up in the summertime. We are the blackberry brambles that cover the burned ground and grow thorns to protect their young fruit. We are the oaks that the lightning split once, but we still shade the ground and shelter the outcasts at the edge of the forest.



We are stubborn and we endure.

Elon's weird behavior at Donald Trump's inauguration. ,8O8I,Is he okay?
Trump RAISES prescription drug costs by as much as 4200%.,Conscious-Quarter423,"Trump RAISES prescription drug costs by as much as 4200%.  
  
He just reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid, over 120 MILLION Americans.  
  
He's pro Big Pharma -- and pro Big Insurance.  
  
He doesn't care about you.  It was all LIES."
I remember when Trump won in 2016. His victory feels darker this time.,SprocketTheWetToad,"It’s the mood of it, I think. Something that is hard to put my finger on. Gone is the exaggerated Trump of 2015 and 2016. All I see when he speaks and acts is a man who clearly has vengeance on his mind.

Take the Capitol One Arena rally last night, for example. He signed Executive Orders in a rush in front of the TV cameras. The spectacle isn’t Trump being goofy and unorthodox anymore. The spectacle is Trump flexing his power in front of everyone who ever challenged him.

He’s a man with nothing to lose at this point. And I’m not sure what that means for the country."
The US deserves every consequence from electing Donald Trump again,arby34,"With news of ICE raids starting to deter immigrant farm workers from showing up to work and the price of foods poised to sky-rocket, the US deserves every possible consequence of giving Donald Trump power again. Hopefully once families literally begin starving because they can't afford to buy food, the huge population of minority folks are consciously excluded from colleges and the workplace because they can be discriminated against, and very preventable diseases make a comeback because of anti-vaccine conspiracies being an official government position, America will wake the fuck up and realize that's not the type of country we want to live in. Or maybe it is. I guess we'll find out here shortly. 

Edit: Holy cow I had no idea this post was going to blow up like this. I thought maybe only a dozen or so people would see this. But just to be clear since my initial post may have come off fairly insensitive - I absolutely DO NOT WANT ANY of our citizens to suffer or have to deal with unnecessary hardship. I want an economic and socially prosperous and peaceful society as much as anyone else. I absolutely hope the next four years end in a better country than we have today, although my confidence is severely lacking. But the thing with democracy is you get out of it what you put into it. So we will all reap any benefits and consequences of our collective decision, whether they be mild or severe. And it's on all of us, whatever happens. "

The peace Plan of Trump for palestine,italianNinja1,"This was the ""deal of the century"" proposed by Trump during his first presidency. The plan consisted on giving 30% of the west bank to Israel and all of Jerusalem. While the new country of palestine would have as a new capital Abu dis(a Village at east of Jerusalem). For compensation the Palestina would have some territories on the desert of Negev that does not border egypt. The palestinian country would consist of a set of enclaves linked by streets controlled by Israel. The new country would have no militar and would rely on Israel on resources such as food, water and Energy. In order to make accept this plan Trump proposed also economic Aid from Israel and usa to the new country"
Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Is Hurting the Food Industry,Puzzleheaded_Park102,"Farm workers are scared to show up for work because of ICE raids, and it’s already causing big problems for farmers and the food supply.

In Bakersfield, California, ICE agents detained people they believed were undocumented, and as a result, many workers stayed home. Farmers were left with acres of unpicked oranges, and the issue could get worse. California’s Central Valley, which produces a huge portion of the nation’s food, depends heavily on undocumented workers.

Some farmers say up to 75% of their workers didn’t show up. Experts warn that if this keeps happening, we could see food prices skyrocket and major economic problems.

Trump’s new policies, like allowing arrests in places like schools and hospitals, are spreading fear across immigrant communities. It’s not just workers staying home—kids aren’t going to school, and families are afraid to go out."
I love how anti-Trump this sub is right now,Witty_Nerve_6438,"I know Reddit is mostly liberal anyway, but it truly warms my heart to see my fellow atheists on here posting all this hate for Trump. Even if it doesn’t change the fact that America is turning into a christofascist hellscape. Now excuse me while I drink myself to oblivion… "
