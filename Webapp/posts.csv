mak_0777,Why is Python so popular?,"Hello, this may be a naive question, but why is Python so popular among data scientists, and why is it so heavily utilized for machine learning? I was under the impression that compiled languages such as C would be better choices for such task, as their faster runtimes would facilitate quicker data analysis.

WaseemHH,Python is awesome but…,"Speaking from my perspective, Python is an awesome language which is closer to human language and has a bunch of great and useful libraries that ease coding. However, I think it shouldn’t be the first language for a programmer to begin his learning with. 

I think a programmer should start with languages like C for example . C language helps understanding fundamentals as C is a low-level programming language that provides a strong foundation in computer science concepts like memory management, pointers, and data structures. Understanding these concepts helps you become a better programmer overall and makes it easier to grasp higher-level languages like Python.

And overall, it’ll develop your problem solving skills and computer resources management, which are important in programming.",speaking from my perspective python is an awesome language which is closer to human language and ha a bunch of great and useful library that ease coding however i think it shouldn t be the first language for a programmer to begin his learning with i think a programmer should start with language like c for example c language help understanding fundamental a c is a low level programming language that provides a strong foundation in computer science concept like memory management pointer and data structure understanding these concept help you become a better programmer overall and make it easier to grasp higher level language like python and overall it ll develop your problem solving skill and computer resource management which are important in programming
Suspicious-Dentist93,Learning Python 2024,"Hi all  
  
I am hoping to start learning Python but not really sure where to start. I haven't programmed in nearly 15 years and was told Python was a good language to start with. I'm looking for a course or some tutorials that someone could recommend, Ideally free but am happy to pay if the course is decent enough.  
  
I've looked at a few bits but its pretty out of date so something a little more up to date would be great.  
  
many thanks in advance

returnofbeans,Where can i learn Python for free? ,"I heard codecademy was a good place, but after teaching me how to do hello world, it was pay blocked. I was pay blocked in only 5 minutes into the tutorial.

codecademy was the place i heard about that was free. I'm not sure if this is a recent change or maybe python was never free. I got about 30 minutes into C++ but from the little that i worked on ren'py, i liked python more.

So it leads back to my topic title, is there are place that teaches Python for free or at least 1 time payment. I want to take it at my own pace and fear subscription services.

edit: saw another thread where this guy posted this link for python courses. $20 for learning python in 60 days. I'm seeing people say udemy is good. Would you guys recommend? a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too. [https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B)

I did try YT and search for people teaching python, but there's so many people doing it, is there one specific channel / guide you guys would recommend if not taking an online course?

EDIT AGAIN: So after spending a few hours trying out Python vs GDScript. I'm going to be going with GD script. I'm loving how it works just slightly better then Python, but both are good. What won me over was that I had already planned on using Gadot as the first game engine i would try. So it only made sense to use the language that is native to that engine. So thank you everyone for your suggestions, but I know what i want to do now.",i heard codecademy wa a good place but after teaching me how to do hello world it wa pay blocked i wa pay blocked in only minute into the tutorial codecademy wa the place i heard about that wa free i m not sure if this is a recent change or maybe python wa never free i got about minute into c but from the little that i worked on ren py i liked python more so it lead back to my topic title is there are place that teach python for free or at least time payment i want to take it at my own pace and fear subscription service edit saw another thread where this guy posted this link for python course for learning python in day i m seeing people say udemy is good would you guy recommend a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too i did try yt and search for people teaching python but there s so many people doing it is there one specific channel guide you guy would recommend if not taking an online course edit again so after spending a few hour trying out python v gdscript i m going to be going with gd script i m loving how it work just slightly better then python but both are good what won me over wa that i had already planned on using gadot a the first game engine i would try so it only made sense to use the language that is native to that engine so thank you everyone for your suggestion but i know what i want to do now
Specific_Ant580,Python is so easy its confusing,"I've been learning Python for a programming assessment for a role I'm aiming for, and I've found myself mesmerized by how easy it seems compared to my primary language, Java, in a way that's hard to put into words.

Some of the things that stand out to me are:

1. No need to specify data types.
2. We just use a colon \`:\` to define the body of functions.
3. There's no need to deal with a lot of jargon when creating functions, like choosing access modifiers or deciding if a function will return a value or not.
4. I don’t have to write ""public static void"" every time I create a new file in VS Code.
5. The syntax is so easy to read that it feels like I'm reading a textbook.
6. Strings function like arrays... what's up with that??
7. Have you ever tried to run a simple ""Hello World"" program in a Java IDE or text editor and noticed the time it takes to compile? Python feels like it compiles and runs almost instantly.
8. Python reads the code line by line. With Java, if there's a single error, the program won't run at all. But in Python, it continues to execute until it reaches the error, which makes finding errors much easier.
9. Everything seems to happen on the same page. With Java (or maybe it's just me), I create every method outside the main method, which makes it confusing to keep track of them all.

It feels so cool programming in Python that I’m honestly a little scared. It feels like I’m in the honeymoon phase, where I’m just waiting to discover the one thing that will make me hate Python. What do you think?

Less than 25minutes later her head was submerged in her water bowl and she had her mouth open with her head completely under water. I took her out of the tank and although there was some minimal movement still happening just moments later she was lifeless. I’m a 27 year old male and crying my eyes out.

NukishPhilosophy,Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!,"Hi all,

[I recently created a course on learning Python with Fantasy Football for complete beginners.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com)

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football. 

The overall goal of my course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. A lot of people have reported back to me that this course was the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after going through countless udemy courses and e-books. I don't think that's because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great ones out there, especially on YouTube (Brad Traversy, Cody Schafer, etc). I think it's because the best, fastest, and most pleasant way to learn to code is to apply it to something you enjoy and can be useful to you right away. For example, most beginner machine learning with Python courses introduce you to predictive analysis by having you predict housing prices. That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to get introduced to predictive analysis by predicting WR fantasy football performance? 

With this in mind, each section of my course has some sort of fantasy football focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. My course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to rank players in to tiers for fantasy football. It comes with 16 sections of material, 14 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I work from home, so I usually respond within a couple minutes to 2 days max).

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content [since my first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/en8xte/guide_to_setting_up_python_for_fantasy_football/), so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season! 

**Just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select three people to get free lifetime access to the course.**

Edit:

I'll make the selection at 10PM EST tonight and post the results at the bottom here. If you win, I'll also be sending you a PM on how to access the course!

Also, some people already ordered. If you want to order it already that's cool, you'll get a full refund if you're randomly selected by the draw. You'll just have to let me know after what email you used at checkout.

MyManagerIsAnIdiot,Python is a godsend for work,"I wanted to just thank the community for everything here.  Its a real tool to have in your arsenal when things get tough.  Today was the first day I put it into use and it was all due to lurking around this subreddit from people helping out others.   

  


My manger felt like pissing me off at work right before the weekend today giving me a huge workload come 4PM.  I was tasked to combine a lot of information with multiple excel sheets that were not formatted alike and he wanted a report by 5PM.  I guess he was thinking I would be manually doing this by opening up each sheet and copying and pasting the information together.  Little did he know I've been reading about python and learning on the side.  The pandas library immediately sprung into my head saying this is going to be easy - dump the raw data frame clean it and merge it together afterwards.  I was not confident writing my own code but poking around with some help from chat gpt plus a bit of self knowledge i was able to finish it in 20 minutes.  



Funniest thing was after I finished, I sat there pretending to go over emails and he came by asking ""Are you going to be able to provide me the report?  Looks like you will have to stay late to finish this"" with his smug ass look on his face.  He left early and I sent him what he needed right after he was gone.

NukishPhilosophy,Learn Python with the NBA Giveaway!,"Hi everyone,

I recently came out with a course on learning Python with NBA data for complete beginners. (some of you may know me from /r/fantasyfootball)

[Link to the course here](https://www.fantasydatapros.com/basketball)

This is a giveaway I'm doing for lifetime access. **Just upvote and comment anything below to enter**. 

For those who don't know, Python is a beginner friendly programming language that's very popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with basketball.

The overall goal of the course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging subject matter you probably enjoy if you're on this sub - basketball. A lot of people have reported back to me that my courses are the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after countless udemy courses and e-books. I dont think thats because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great out ones there, prob better than me, who I've learned a ton from and owe a lot to like Brad Traversy, Corey Schafer, and Sentdex. I actually think the reason is because the best and most engaging way to learn to code is through subject matters that interest you. For example, a lot of beginner data science courses start you out by predicting housing prices.  That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to introduce you to predictive analysis by teaching you to make a model to predict the NBA MVP this season? 

With this in mind, each section of the course has some sort of basketball/NBA focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. The course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to predict points scored for the season for certain players, predict who will be MVP, and rank players into tiers for fantasy basketball. It comes with 10 sections of material, 8 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I'm on Slack all day so I usually respond pretty quickly).

Anyway, the mods ok'd it, so I figured id do a giveaway - **just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course) 10 people to get free lifetime access to the course after the Nuggets game tonight.** (Will select more if a lot of people enter)

Thanks for reading. You guys are awesome

And good luck!

edit:

Some ppl asked about cost. It’s $55, but you can use the code `NBA` for $15 off

Inner_Language_7135,I think I made a bad purchase (8ball python) ,"Looking for some advice on what to do. I went to an expo today just to look around (famous last words) and came across a baby 8 ball for $250. I recognized the breeder and have heard nothing but good things about them so I bought her. They were very transparent about her price being low due to a kink in her neck so she should not be a breeder. But, said she eats fine and has already taken 5 meals (she is only a month old) I got her home and got her all set up, left her in her enclosure to decompress, and went to work. I was excited to see her when I got back and how she was exploring her enclosure and instead found that she hadn’t moved at all other than relaxing out of her tight knot she was in, but still just balled up in the middle of the tank 8 hours later. Not attempt to explore or go to either of her hides, just nothing. I found the breeder on all of their socials and saw nothing of her till I went to their YouTube. They have a video of the egg cutting of her clutch where it was her and two other super black pastels (8 balls) and all 3 had deformities. In the video they specify that she is the worst of the three and seems almost neurological with her movement but that they think it’s due to her kinking and messes with her orientation. I’ve been watching her and I looks like she tries to move but can’t really get anywhere and I’m worried I just got a special needs snake with very limited to no mobility. I don’t exactly have an issue with having to give her extra care, but it’s the kind of thing where I’m going to be obsessing over her health and worrying constantly. Not to mention I don’t want to get attached just to see her not make it, and invest in an unhealthy animal like I have done so many times before to end up heart broken. The expo is in town for one more day so now im trying to decide if I should just try to take her back tomorrow or keep her and give her a chance. I was so excited about her but now I feel like I just got played. 

TLDR: I found one of my dream snakes but I think it’s immobile.

bee_advised,the R vs Python debate is exhausting,"just pick one or learn both for the love of god.

yes, python is excellent for making a production level pipeline. but am I going to tell epidemiologists to drop R for it? nope. they are not making pipelines, they're making automated reports and doing EDA. it's fine. do I tell biostatisticans in pharma to drop R for python? No! These are scientists, they are focusing on a whole lot more than building code. R works fine for them and there are frameworks in R _built specifically for them_.

and would I tell a data engineer to replace python with R? no. good luck running R pipelines in databricks and maintaining its code.

I think this sub underestimates how many people write code for data manipulation, analysis, and report generation that _are not_ and _will not_ build a production level pipelines. 

Data science is a huge umbrella, there is room for both freaking languages.
